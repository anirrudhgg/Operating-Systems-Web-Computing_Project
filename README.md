# Operating Systems and Web Computing Project
This is the Final Project for an OperatingSystems/Web Computing Project, This repository contains 2 parts:

CONTENTS
1. A Demo project created using the flutter extension within VS code. Once the extension is downloaded, the extension can be accessed via terminal on mac. 
This opens a Webpage on the browser which has a title 'Flutter Demo Home Page'. It also contains a button on the bottom right with a '+' logo and a counter in
the middle of the screen that updates everytime the button is clicked.
2. The Final Project
This Opens a webpage on the browser which was created using the flutter extension on VS code. It is called 'Loadout Locker' and its a webpage where you can
choose your mode of play (either PC or console which is further split into xbox or ps5). Within that for pc games, you can choose settings such as 'DPI', 
'Sensitivty' and 'Graphics Quality', For Console games you can input the numerical percentage value of how much of the game you have completed.


STEPS
The Steps to download and run the Flutter app within Vs Code and also how to use the Terminal to create the webpage 
Note: For Mac you need to either have Xcode in apple or you should modify the settings in the safari browser and modify the code to run on the web server.

Step 1. Download the Extensions of Flutter onto your VS Code from the extensions tab
Step 2. Open a new project with the flutter extension by typing 'flutter create [Project_name]' and replace the dots with the name of the project.
Step 3. Access the project folder by going to the terminal and typing 'cd [folder_name]'
Step 4. Access the 'folder_name/lib/main.dart' and then the code can be modfied as necessary 
Step 5. Run the terminal with 'flutter run -d web-server' and copy and paste the link onto the webpage.
